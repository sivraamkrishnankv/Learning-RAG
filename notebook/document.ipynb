Unlike bulk forms or composite-grade variants, which are \\ncovered in other contexts, mono-to-few-layer 2D materials demand a distinct ecosystem—spanning \\ncleanroom infrastructure, atomically precise material growth/synthesis, wafer-scale integration, \\nand advanced device architectures. As these technologies transition from laboratory discoveries \\nto real world deployment, countries and corporations are mobilizing dedicated programs and \\ninvestments. This section outlines how global leaders are shaping this transition through policy \\nframeworks, supply chain strategies, flagship programs, and economic projections. The aim is \\nto map the readiness, momentum, and strategic intent surrounding these materials—not just as \\nscientific curiosities, but as enablers of future-defining industries.\\n3.1 Market Dynamics\\nThe \\nmono-to-few-layer \\n2D \\nmaterials \\necosystem—particularly \\nits \\nsemiconductor, \\noptoelectronic, and quantum device applications—is at an inflection point where fundamental \\nresearch is beginning to translate into early-stage technology demonstrators. While the \\ncurrent market size for monolayer 2D materials is modest due to the lack of scalable \\nmanufacturing and integration technologies, its long-term disruptive potential is significant. \\nBy 2035, 2D semiconductors such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are projected \\nto occupy niche but critical segments of the semiconductor value chain, especially in logic \\nbeyond silicon, flexible electronics, and ultra-low power neuromorphic processors. Various \\nestimates suggest that even a 5%–10% market replacement or co-integration of 2D materials \\nin the global semiconductor market—expected to cross $1.5 trillion by 2035—would translate \\nto a $75–150 billion technology segment. Moreover, new applications such as ultrathin \\nquantum processors, spin-valleytronic memory, and skin-integrated neuromorphic chips are \\nexpected to create entirely new verticals, adding an estimated $50–100 billion in adjacent \\nmarkets not currently served by silicon-based platforms [1], [2].\\n3.2 Geopolitical Factors and Supply Chain Vulnerabilities\\nThe mono-to-few-layer 2D ecosystem is deeply intertwined with advanced foundry access, \\nprecision metrology, high-purity precursors, and lithographic infrastructure—components \\nthat are largely controlled by a few nations. This geopolitical control of these assets renders \\nthe 2D technology value chain vulnerable to export restrictions, sanctions, and technological \\nblacklisting. For instance, China has made substantial investments in 2D fabs, notably in \\ntransition metal dichalcogenide synthesis, but faces potential blockades in advanced \\npatterning tools from ASML and metrology instruments from the U.S. and Japan [4]. Similarly, \\nU.S. strategic controls over gallium and graphite—critical feedstocks for 2D materials—\\ncould disrupt multiple countries’ supply chains. This techno-strategic fragmentation may \\neither catalyse national self-reliance or lead to technological balkanization, where critical \\nadvancements remain siloed behind geopolitical barriers [5].\\n3.3 Impact of Sanctions and Tariffs\\nSanctions and tariff regimes have already begun to shape the future of advanced materials \\nR&D. The U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, along with export controls on semiconductor tools, \\ndirectly affects the development and scale-up of 2D-based semiconductor technologies. \\nFor example, U.S. export restrictions on atomic-layer deposition and ultra-clean chemical \\nprecursors have significantly slowed down 2D FET integration efforts in Chinese fabs. \\nSimilarly, Chinese retaliatory export licensing on gallium and graphite—both essential for'),\n",

China holds the largest patent portfolio in graphene and TMD-\\nbased semiconductors, with over 10,000 2D-related patents filed between 2015 and 2023 \\n[7]. This includes device-level innovations on MoS2 FETs, photodetectors, and integrated \\nheterostructure circuits. South Korea, led by institutions such as KAIST and Samsung \\nAdvanced Institute of Technology, has demonstrated sub-10 nm 2D FETs and monolithic 3D \\nintegration using 2D channels. The U.S., through DARPA, NSF, and DOE programs, continues \\nto fund fundamental 2D research in universities like MIT, Stanford, and UC Berkeley, focusing \\non quantum coherence, valleytronics, and CMOS-compatible 2D integration. Europe, \\nalthough less aggressive in device scale-up, leads in metrology and modeling tools through \\norganisations such as IMEC and Fraunhofer. These countries are also the primary contributors \\nto flagship roadmaps like the IRDS (International Roadmap for Devices and Systems), where \\n2D materials are earmarked as key candidates for sub-1 nm nodes [8].\\n3.5 Indian Scenario\\nWhile India has the talent and growing semiconductor ambitions, our efforts in monolayer-\\nto-few layer 2D materials-based technology development is still at a very nascent stage \\nCurrent research is largely focused on materials synthesis and basic device characterisation, \\nwith limited work on wafer-scale integration, heterostructure engineering, and deployable \\ndevice prototypes.\\nCountries like the U.S., South Korea, and China have already started integrating 2D \\nsemiconductors into their next-generation chip and quantum computing roadmaps.  It is of \\nutmost importance for India to launch a dedicated national program for these technologies. \\nInstitutions such as IISc Bangalore have developed early-stage n- and p-type 2D FETs, 2D \\ncircuits, memory prototypes, quantum devices, sensors, optoelectronic devices, RF devices, \\nmaterial growth etc. with few IITs also contributing to research in sensors, exfoliated \\nheterostructures and material synthesis, but we need to have an ambitious national program \\nwith a 10 year strategic roadmap to build end to end capabilities along the value chain.  \\nWith a strong focused effort that aligns talent, research, infrastructure, and policy, we have \\nthe opportunity to leapfrog into the global 2D materials race and avoid being locked out of \\nfuture high value semiconductors and quantum stacks.\\n3.6 Examples of Global Best Practices\\nSeveral countries have launched coordinated national programs that formally recognise \\nthe strategic importance of 2D semiconductors. In the United States, the National Science \\nFoundation’s “2D Crystal Consortium” supports scalable synthesis and integration pathways \\nfor wafer-scale 2D materials, with a focus on device-relevant applications. The European \\nUnion’s €1 billion Graphene Flagship—one of the largest research initiatives in Europe—has \\nmoved beyond materials discovery into system-level integration, targeting flexible electronics, \\nquantum photonics, and advanced sensor systems. China’s 14th Five-Year Plan identifies \\n2D materials as a priority under its “frontier materials and quantum information” agenda, \\nchanneling funding through state-backed research and industry consortia. South Korea’s \\n“K-Materials Initiative” supports research into foldable and neuromorphic electronics based \\non 2D semiconductors, and facilitates public-private partnerships for translational R&D.

The window to lead, or even \\ncatch up, is rapidly narrowing. \\nWithout immediate, mission-mode action, India risks becoming technologically dependent in \\nthe very sectors that will define the next generation of electronics and quantum computing. \\nOur electronics and semiconductor sectors may be locked into low-value, legacy nodes, while \\nother nations scale high-margin AI chips, quantum sensors, and neuromorphic architectures \\nusing 2D materials. This will not only constrain India’s share in the future semiconductor \\nmarket but also weaken its ability to set global technology standards.\\nStrategic vulnerabilities would further deepen if India lacks domestic capacity to fabricate or \\nintegrate 2D material-based chips, thereby extending our dependence on an already fragile \\nand geopolitically tense supply chain.
